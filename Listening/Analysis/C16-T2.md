好拉胯，好几个是跑神了，导致我没听到就过去了，所以只能自己随便写了。

1 原文提到 And some of them are in a frame - should I take them out before I send them? 男的回答说 yes，因此这里说的是不要放在 frame 里。

2 原文提到 We charge £195 for 300 to 400 photos for the basic service，因此这里是 195，我也不知道为啥我听到的是 719😂。

3 原文提到 Then we'll let you know how much it is, and once we've received the payment, we'll send the parcel off to you. 即 payment is required。

4 原文提到 So I could have one called 'Grandparents' for instance? 所以文件夹的名字是 Grandparents。

8 原文提到 I've got a few that aren't properly in focus. Can you do anything to make that better? 也就是题干中说的对焦不好，因此为 focus。

13 原文提到 But there's only one serving point, so most pupils have to wait a considerable time to be served，即只有一个服务窗口，因此排队时间比较长，与 A 项描述一致。

14 原文提到 is to discuss with your children each morning which type of food they want to eat that day, so they can go straight to the relevant serving point，即确定了哪种食物后，直结过去对的窗口排队，与 A 项描述一致。

17 原文提到 We'll ask pupils to make suggestions，与 A 项描述一致。

多选题做错的原因只有一个，就是忽略了题干中的 new，人家问的是未来有哪些项目是新加的，我选的都是现有的。

19 原文提到 we have a well-equipped performance centre, and we're going to start drama classes in there，即 acting 课程会在未来开启。

20 原文提到 And a former pupil has given a magnificent grand piano to the school，即学校会有一个钢琴供学生使用，因此 piano 也会是新增的部分。

24 女生提到 I was OK with the planning, but I got marked down for the self-assessment as well，随后又解释了下，然后男生说 right，因此他们都对 self-assessment 有困惑。

27 没注意听到复数，写的 human，少写了 s， 

28 短时记忆有点混乱，写成了 session，原文提到的是 unnecessary stress，因此这里为 stress。

30 漏听了，自己写了 commit。原文提到 And the final thing is to think about our research and evaluate it，and 和 evaluate 连读需要注意，因此这里为 evaluate。

## P4

5/10

35 原文提到 because it forces their brain to process things more quickly，因此这里是要提升 brain 的功能。

36 原文提到 and having greater motivation to be more active and do daily activities，个人感觉定位词 activities 和答案 motivation 有点远。我没听到 motivation，但是听到了 active，所以我写了 active。解析给的是 greater 和 more 同义，我则用 more 去定位了。

38 没理解 uses up as 是啥意思，查了下是用作。解析给的是 uses up 对应原文的 burns，many 对应 370，这两个我都没听到。我只听到了最后的 kickboxing，所以我写了 boxing😂。原文为 a class lasting 40 minutes burns about 370 calories。

39 这里也是漏听了，所以自己写了 anxious。原文提到 when women with obesity did Zumba three times a week for 16 weeks，因此这里需要填入 obesity。

40 原文提到 More importantly, the women enjoyed the class so much that they made it a habit and continued to attend classes at least once a week，因此这里说 zumba 成为了一种 habit，我也不知道从哪里听来的 game。
