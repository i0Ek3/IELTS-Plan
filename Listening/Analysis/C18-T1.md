# C18-T1 Listening

一整套真题按时模考的，总分 6。

## P1

8/10

这篇应该全对才是。

1 第一个真的是气死，我写的是 DW307YZ，后来检查的时候，我就在想，我经常听到的 code 似乎是 6 位啊，然后强行把 0 给删了😂。

2 这个也太拉胯了，问的是 date，我以为只写日期就好了，所以只写了 24，结果是还要写月份，即 24 April，真的是气炸。

## P2

## P3

6/10

这个听力听着听着就跟不上节奏了，不知道说哪呢，然后就结束了。

23 原文提到 Perhaps she thinks students are a bit narrow-minded about the industry，说明别人对他们的评价不客观，与 A 项描述一致。

25 原文女生提到 I promised myself that I'd go through this course and keep an open mind till the end，男生说 But I think it's better to pick an area of the industry，表明他们两个人对于何时选择 career 是有分歧的，与 B 项描述一致。

29 原文提到 They also take things back to the store if they aren't right. Yeah. Imagine you worked in an expensive shop and you found out the garments sold there were being returned because they … fell apart in the wash! 说明顾客会把衣服退回来，因为某种原因，与 A 项描述一致。

## P4

5/10

33 我先写了 helicopters，然后听到了后面给写了一个 dars，真的无语。看了下，后面一句听力中提到了 used darts，所以我认为和题干的 made use of 表述一致。实际原文在第一句里提到 A team of vets and park rangers flew over the park in helicopters and targeted a group，说明使用了直升机来运送目标。

35 原文提到 So all the elephants had to be placed on their sides，但是前面的那句话也很迷惑，提到 the team had to make sure none of the elephants were lying on their chests，所以我写的是 chests 而不是 sides。

36 我听到了 ing 的发音，刚开始写的 breeding，但是我没有听到 d 的发音，所以改成了 breath，没写 ing。实际原文提到 It was very important to keep an eye on their breathing，breathing 发音较轻，容易听错。

38 漏听了，自己写了 breeding。原文提到 Employment prospects have improved enormously, contributing to rising living standards for the whole community，其中 prospects 和 opportuinities 相对，因此这里填 employment。 

39 漏听了，自己写了 predators。原文提到 In fact, many of them volunteered to give up their weapons，与题干说的减少含义一致，所以这里填 weapons。
